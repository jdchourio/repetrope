This is Chrome extension that easies watching repetrope pages. 

This extension changes the image source for the repetrope images. If the extension is used in combination with the "Hover Zoom" extension it increases the usability of the repetrope pages. 

The extension checks if a high quality version of the image exists. If it does, loads that version. If it doesn't loads, the low quality.
